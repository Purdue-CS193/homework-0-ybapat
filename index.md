# Yash Bapat's First CS193 Homework

- The thing I love most is how the class introduces me to things I haven't seen before, like the terminal and GitHub
- I also like that this class prepares me for future CS Classes
- I like that the slides have a lot of info but there are still memes to keep it light
- I like that there is a homework schedule, so I can be sure I will not miss any deadlines
- I particularly like that this class is taught by students who have been in my shoes
